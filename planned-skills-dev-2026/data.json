I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative.</p><p>So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works.</p><p>I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into).</p><p>In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted.</p><p>In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort.</p><p>So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus.</p><p>That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie.</p>",

I am not going to just deny myself access to apps on schedule -- my brain never clicked schedule, not even once in my life -- but through a persistent and sustainable self-change from deep within. It's slow but it's beginning to work.<p>- MANDATORY: Get more intimate with my Neovim. I've always kind of half-arsed my editors / IDEs, I always found it annoying to become a deep expert. This must change; surface-level skills rob you of productivity. I already am hugely annoyed by my typing speed, which is quite excellent but still not enough to work almost at the speed of thought. I want to achieve something near to these levels.</p><p>- OPTIONAL: Integrate closer with one ore more LLM agents for coding. I have not paid for any yet but copying-pasting from a web UI gets tiring. Sometimes you really just want to say \"OK, now remove that duplicate test and include that edge case\" and see it materialize in 20 seconds. I am not against paying, it's just that so far the paid tiers have not been a blocker. Well, seems like they are now.</p><p>- MANDATORY: Prioritize body. I have health conditions and I have a relatively good visibility how to fix them. I regularly end up desperately trying to solve more and more problems on the computer just so I don't get up and start a workout. I started turning this around but it's way too slow and time and age don't wait for anyone.</p><p>In general: connect better with myself, forgive myself all the previous mistakes, understand why and how they came to be and remove the root causes, put myself on a better path.

As a kid I was into development and anything tech, but for some reason resisted formal education or even working in the field.

After the military I did an entrepreneurial stint, then I took the comfortable, \"guaranteed\" route, in regard to career- wherever I could land in the US Fed. Govt, where I did about 12 years in 5 or so different positions... I was raised to, and had always worked hard - but I never really had much risk in regard to losing my job until recently.<p>Preceding wall of text to explain how hard the realization hit, for practically the first time in my life, when stuff started going crazy in the feds: \"damn... I really could be ~6mo away from losing it all.\" As many of you know, the market was and is ridiculous. Thankfully a few years back, even when I \"knew\" I didn't need it, I finished my BS:CS before my GI Bill dried up. And then as another challenge took the Security+ exam before I started applying for a job in the private sector. A lot of people in this industry like to say none of that matters-- which might certainly be true, but I can say without a doubt that those pieces of paper are the main reason I was about to get out of the hole I was in.
