        "comment": "This is a new years resolution question barely in disguise, but they're fun cause a lot of us are cooped up, barely 4 days into winter, 86ish to go, and we're champing at the bit for change.<p>I am pretty sure I'm a 50th percentiler. I'm mid 40s, kinda burned out but still struggling forward in my ok-but-not-hollywood IT career, I still have a passion for doing things well in a technical society that values doing things cheap (and well). The things I am known for being good at, I still google daily, and for a long time, I've been hungry for a change - any change - but especially one that isn't chaotically negative.</p><p>So in 2026, I wanna learn how dirt works.</p><p>I actually have a giant box of dirt sitting on a shelf at the UNH community co-op soil analysis lab, waiting to give me some kind of data about the soil behind my house. (Or is it dirt? I don't know what I'm getting into).</p><p>In 2024 I tried growing some corn. It never sprouted.</p><p>In 2025 I tried growing some corn. It sprouted and a few ears had enough kernels to make one full mouthful. Tasty, but maybe 7 calories of food for a year of effort.</p><p>So in 2026 I'd like to grow: one entire fully formed ear of sweet corn. Anything else is a bonus.</p><p>That's what I wanna develop in 2026 - learning how soil works enough to make it make a thing.  Small moves, Ellie.</p>",

I have been starting to use AI about 12 months ago and, as an experienced engineer of 30+ years professionally, I am blown away by how productive it makes me. What I used to be able to do in a week now takes me a day, what I used to be able to do in a month now takes me week, etc.<p>So, 2026 is going to be the year I'm going to run this experiment on myself and see what I can accomplish with this way of working.</p>",
